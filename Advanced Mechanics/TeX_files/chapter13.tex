\chapter{A Historical Overview}
We begin by a lucid overview of the history of Quantum Mechanics . Here we have avoided going into details of some very important Quantum Mechanical phenomena such as the Hydrogen atom, Spin and theiry history. You may refer to \cite{p34} to learn more about them. \cite{} is an excellent exposition of "spin" which we'll come to understand in the next few chapters.
\section{The Pre-Quantum Era}
In the 1850s, when Fraunhofer used his experimental setup to analyze the spectra of sunlight he found something remarkable.

Dark lines 

Thus, they concluded that Sun must contain Sodium.
\section{Blackbody Radiation}
We can consider a black body to consist of electromagnetic radiation in thermal equilibrium with the walls of the cavity. When they are in thermal equilibrium, the average rate of emission of radiation equals their average rate of absorption of radiation. \\

\noindent The Rayleigh Jeans theory was constructed on the notion that when the walls of an object is in thermal equilibrium, in other words, the temperature of the walls is equal to the "temperature" of radiation. We will see what we mean by the "temperature" of an electromagnetic wave. \\

\noindent If we take the walls of a cavity to consist of oscillating charged particles (about its equilibrium) coupled to a standing-wave mode of an electromagnetic field. This can be seen from Maxwell's theory of electromagnetic waves, which states that a moving charged particle radiates an electromagnetic wave. A point to be noted is that the frequency of the oscillating charge is equal to the frequency of its coupled electromagnetic wave. So then, it is safe to say that in thermal equilibrium, the average energy of the oscillating charge is equal to the average energy of the coupled standing-wave mode of that electromagnetic field. \\

\noindent Now we can see that the oscillating particle has a quadratic potential energy, $H_{pot}$  of $\frac{1}{2}aq^2$ and a kinetic energy $H_{kin}$ of $\frac{p^2}{2m}$, so according to the equipartition theorem, in thermal equilibrium the average energy is,
\begin{equation}
	\braket{H}=\braket{H_{pot}}+\braket{H_{kin}}=\frac{1}{2}k_BT+\frac{1}{2}k_BT=k_BT
\end{equation}	
Hence the energy of the wave is also taken to be $k_BT$, and can be thought to have a "temperature" of T. \\

\noindent This forms the foundation of the Rayleigh Jeans theory, following which we will derive the Rayleigh-Jeans formula.

\section{Deriving the Rayleigh-Jeans Formula}
We start off with the axiom that the energy distribution of a black-body radiation does not depend on the shape of the cavity (which can be proven experimentally). For ease of calculations, we take te shape of the cavity to be a cube. We also assume that the waves vanish at the walls, or in other words, do not pass through them.\\
\noindent The number of standing electromagnetic waves in a cube of length L needs to be calculated. \\
Let us take the wave equation for the standing electromagnetic wave,
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial^2E_x}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2E_x}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2E_x}{\partial z^2}+k^2E_x=0
\end{equation}
Where $E_x=E_x(x,y,z)$ and $k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}=\frac{2\pi f}{c}$.
Assuming that $E_x=u(x)v(y)w(z)$ (by variable separable method), we can separate Equation (2) into three ordinary differential equations of the type,
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}+k^2_xu=0
\end{equation}
Where $k^2=k^2_x+k^2_y+k^2_z$. By inspection, we can see that Equation (3) is an equation for a simple harmonic oscillator and has the solution,
\begin{equation}
	u(x)=B\cos k_xx+C\sin k_xx
\end{equation}
Applying necessary boundary conditions so that $E_x$ or $u$ is 0 at $x=0$ and at $x=L$ leads to $B=0$ and $k_xL=n_x\pi$ where $n_x=1,2,3,...$, (since we are considering standing electromagnetic waves and look at only the positive region of the k-space) similar solutions are obtained for $v(y)$ and $w(z)$, giving the solution,
\begin{equation}
	E_x(x,y,z)=A\sin (k_xx)sin(k_yy)\sin(k_zz)
\end{equation}
Where,
\begin{equation}
	k^2=\frac{\pi ^2}{L^2}(n^2_x+n^2_y+n^2_z)
\end{equation}
and $n_x$, $n_y$ and $n_z$ are postive integers.\\
Now, we take Equation (6) to give us the distance from the origin to a point in $k$-space, or often called the "Reciprocal" space (due to the units of $k$ being $(length)^-1$).\\
Let us take a coordinate system corresponding to the $k$-space (as shown in Figure 1), with the axes being $k_x$, $k_y$ and $k_z$. And we know that $k_x=n_x\pi/l$, $k_y=n_y\pi/L$, and $k_z=n_z\pi/L$, so the points in $k$-space are separated by $\pi/L$ along each axis, and there is one standing wave in $k$-space per $(\pi/L)^3$ of volume. The number of standing waves, $N(k)$ having wavenumbers between $k$ and $k+dk$ is then simply the volume between $k$ and $k+dk$ divided by $(\pi/L)^3$. The volume between $k$ and $k+dk$ is simply the volume of a spherical shell of thickness $dk$ multiplied by $1/8$ (since we need only the positive quadrant of the k-space, hence 1/4 of the volume of sphere), so that
\begin{equation}
	N(k)dk=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\pi k^2dk}{(\pi/L)^3}=\frac{Vk^2dk}{2\pi^2}
\end{equation}
Where $V=L^3$ is the volume of the cavity.\\
For any electromagnetic wave, there are two perpendicular polarisations for each mode, so Equation (6) should be increased by a factor of 2, becoming,
\begin{equation}
	\frac{N(k)dk}{V}=\frac{k^2dk}{\pi^2}
\end{equation}
From using the expression $k=2\pi f/c$ to obtain $k$ and $dk$ and substituting in Equation (8) gives us $N(f)$,
\begin{equation}
	N(f)df=\frac{8\pi f^2}{c^3}df
\end{equation}
And from this, the number of modes per unit volume between $\lambda$ and $\lambda + d\lambda$ can be derived from Equation (9) by using the expression $f=c/\lambda$ to get $\lambda$ and $d\lambda$ to get,
\begin{equation}
	N(\lambda)d\lambda=\frac{8\pi}{\lambda^4}d\lambda
\end{equation}
Now, each mode of oscilation has energy of $k_BT$, so the energy in the range $\lambda$ to $\lambda+d\lambda$ is $k_BTN(\lambda)d\lambda$. Hence the energy density in this region is,
\begin{equation}
	u(\lambda)d\lambda = k_BTN(\lambda)=\frac{8\pi k_BT}{\lambda^4}d\lambda
\end{equation}
This is the Rayleigh Jeans expression for spectral density in the range $\lambda$ to $d\lambda$
Considering the energy to be a continuous variable, then the average energy per oscillator is $k_BT$ and the Rayleigh Jeans formula for $u(\lambda)$ holds true. The Rayleigh Jeans formula also behaves perfectly well for long wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectum. It also agrees with the Wien's scaling formula,
\begin{equation}
	u(\lambda)=\frac{8\pi k_BT}{\lambda^4}=\frac{f(\lambda T)}{\lambda^5}
\end{equation}
However, we will see in the next section why this is not a correct scaling function.\\

\section{Failure of the Rayleigh Jeans theory in explaining the Stefan-Boltzmann Law}
\subsection{Incorrect Scaling function}
From the previous equation for the scaling function, we can see that $f(\lambda T)=8k_BT$. So from this, we can notice that as $\lambda$ decreases, the u($\lambda$) also increases. This means that higher the temperature, more lower wavelength waves are emitted, for example, a campfire emits a large amount of short wavelength microwaves (which is very deadly, but thankfully that isnt how things work in nature) according to this law. Hence, the law fails in this regard.

\subsection{The Ultraviolet Catastrophe}
Inspecting the Rayleigh-Jeans formula, and attempting to find the total energy density (by integrating with appropriate limits) of the black body gives us an interesting result,
\begin{equation}
	u=\int_{\infty}^{0}=u(\lambda)d\lambda=\int_{\infty}^{0}\frac{8\pi k_B T}{\lambda^4}d\lambda=\infty
\end{equation}
Here we see that the energy density is infinite, which is easy to figure out that this is nonsensical. It implies that if a cavity filled with radiation radiates infinite amount of energy. This was named by Paul Ehrenfest as the "Ultraviolet Catastrophe" However, Stefan found out that the energy radiated is proportional to $T^4$, hence, trying to explain the Stefan-Boltzmann Law using the Rayleigh-Jeans formula for energy density will end in vain.
\subsection{Consequences}
As the Rayeigh-Jeans formula failed to address shorter wavelengths, Planck decided to use a different approach to explain the black body radiation curve. He decided not to assume that the average energy of an oscillator in the wall to be $k_BT$. He knew how $u(\lambda)$ varies for short wavelengths, using the Wien's formula and wanted u($\lambda$) to be proportional to T for longer wavelengths. This lead to the formulation of the Planck's formula, which perfectly described the radiation curve.
\section{Planck's Law}
Max Planck, suggested that the energy transfer can radiation i.e. standing waves and walls of container
i.e. atoms must be discrete not continuous as fundamental discrete energy units $E = nhv$. Thus he came up with the relation:
\begin{equation}
\expval{E} = \frac{\sum^{\infty}_{n=0} nhve^{-nhv/kT}}{\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}e^{-nhv/kT}}
\end{equation}
Now,
\begin{equation}
u(\lambda, T) = N \expval{E} = \frac{8 \pi}{\lambda^{4}}.\frac{hc/ \lambda}{e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda k T}}-1}
\end{equation}
This turned out to be right distribution! However, nobody at that time understood what it meant. Planck himself considered this to be a mathematical trick. In a sense, it implies that energy transfer is quantized. But almost no one took it seriously. It would take a revolutionary mind to truly understand it and push it to the extreme.
\section{Photoelectric Effect}
It was only Albert Einstein who took Planck's idea to the extreme. He postulated that energy transfer itself must be quantized and transmitted through discrete packets of energy called photons. Einstein drew this conclusion as an interpretation of Phillip Lenard's experimentation of what is called the "Photoelectric effect" i.e. a phenomenon in which electromagnetic radiation incident on a metallic surface causes electron to be emitted from the surface.
\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\begin{itemize}
\item Evacuated tube, with a metallic photosurface $P$, in which light passes through a small opening and causes electrons to be ejected
\item These
electrons are collected by a collecting surface $C$
\item Since the collecting plate is connected to the negative
terminal of the power supply, it will repel normally repel
electrons and only absorb the energetic ones
\item  As the voltage is made more negative, there is a point at
which the current ceases, called stopping
voltage/potential $V_{S}$
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Observation}
\begin{itemize}
\item The intensity of the incident light neither affects the
kinetic energy or the stopping voltage, solely the
number of electrons emitted
\item  The frequency of light influences the emitted
electrons' energy
\item  Electrons are emitted without a time delay.
\item  There is a minimum/threshold frequency, $\phi$, below
which no electrons are emitted
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interpretation}
If light were a wave:
\begin{itemize}
\item Intense beams, which have more energy, should cause
the emissions of electrons with higher kinetic energy
\item Frequency should play a role in the energy of
electrons
\item Low intensity beams should cause a time delay, since
energy would need to accumulate before the emission
of an electron.

\end{itemize}
Einstein created this equation for it,
\begin{equation}
	E_{Photon} = h \gamma = T + \phi
\end{equation}
Where,
$$\phi = hv_{0}$$
$$T = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$$
In summary, Planck said "energy exchange is quantized" whereas Einstein said "energy itself is quantized".
\section{The de Broglie Hypothesis}
In , the French physicist de Brogile proposed that this wave like structure applies to electrons too and follows the equation:
\begin{equation}
	p = \frac{h}{\lambda} = \frac{2 \pi \hbar}{ \lambda}
\end{equation}
