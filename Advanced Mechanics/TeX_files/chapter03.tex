\subsection{Properties of $\psi_{n}(x)$}
\begin{itemize}
\item As you up in energy, each sucessive state has one more node, starting with zero nodes in $\psi_{1}(x)$
\item They are orthonormal i.e. $\int \psi^{*}_{m}(x) \psi_{n}(x) dx = \delta_{mn}$
\item They are complete that is any other other eigen function $f(x)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of them i.e. $\int \psi^{*}_{m}(x) \psi_{n}(x) dx = \delta_{mn}$
\end{itemize}
