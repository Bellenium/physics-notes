\chapter{Path Integral Formulation}
\section{The Path Integral Recepie}
So far our stratergy has been to find the eigenstates of H then express the propagator in terms of this. However, the path integral formulation cuts one step and gets to the propagator directly. For a single particle in one dimension we follow the following procedure to find $U(x,t;x^{'}, t^{'})$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Draw all paths in the $x-t$ plane connecting $(x^{'}, \dot{t})$ and ()
	\item Find the action $S[x(t)]$ for each path $x(t)$
	\item $U(x,t;x^{'}, t^{'}) = A \sum_{All paths} e^{i\frac{S[x(t)]}{\hbar} }$  ; where $A$ is a normalization factor
\end{enumerate}
