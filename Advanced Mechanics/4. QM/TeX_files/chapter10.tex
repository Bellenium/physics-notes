\chapter{Path Integral Formulation}
\section{The Path Integral Recepie}
So far our stratergy has been to find the eigenstates of H then express the propagator in terms of this. However, the path integral formulation cuts one step and gets to the propagator directly. For a single particle in one dimension we follow the following procedure to find $U(x,t;x^{'}, \dot{t})$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Draw all paths in the x-t plane connecting $(x^{'}, \dot{t})$ and ()
\end{enumerate}
